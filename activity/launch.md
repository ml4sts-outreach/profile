# Wrapping up

Congrats! You now have a simple to maintain long term website.  It takes a *little* bit more thinking to get started, but you have full control, it is free, and it is not vulnerable to attacks. 

There are two main things to consider, maintaining and taking ownership. 

## Maintaining

To maintain, this webiste will always be here.  I will update it and add more details/resources any time I teach the workshop.  I am committed to your success, so I will mark clearly in text if there are things that I add here that do not apply to previous participants. 

Also, the repo is set up to be pretty well documented.  You can go into the site and refresh what you need. 

## Launching your site

As is, your site is "owned" by the github organization `ml4sts-outreach` and your site is visible online at: `ml4sts-outreach.github.io/nsbe50-profile-username`. 
I did this for two reasons: 
- We can help you during the workshop
- Your site is not your "official" profile until you are ready
  
However, you have full admin access to your repo, so 
 you can take ownership and make it your own. This will also mean that I would no longer have direct edit access to your site.  

To do this: 
1. [transfer ownership to yourself](https://docs.github.com/en/repositories/creating-and-managing-repositories/transferring-a-repository#transferring-a-repository-owned-by-your-organization)
2. [rename the repository](https://docs.github.com/en/repositories/creating-and-managing-repositories/renaming-a-repository) to `username.github.io` but with your actual github username in place of `username`.
3. *(otionally)* Buy a custom domain and set up to [use your custom domain](https://docs.github.com/en/pages/configuring-a-custom-domain-for-your-github-pages-site/managing-a-custom-domain-for-your-github-pages-site)


After the first two steps, you will be able to see your website at `username.github.io` instead of `ml4sts-outreach.github.io/nsbe50-profile-username`. 


I buy and manage my domains from [namecheap](https://www.namecheap.com/) but there are many others you can use. The only requirement is that whatever domain provider you choose to buy from gives you DNS panel access, so that you can complete step 3 above.

##  Get started


First, you will need to [create a github account](https://github.com/signup)


```{warning}
At NBSE50 use the link provided in person.
```

the link to copy the template for the workshop is different during an actual workshop, that gives
access to a version to provide Dr. Brown and any workshop helpers write permission to your site

Then you need to fork the [template](https://github.com/ml4sts-outreach/template-profile) or **"accept the assignment"** from Dr. Brown.

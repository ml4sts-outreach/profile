### Version Control is worth it

- git keeps track of versions of your work
- currently the norm; other version control systems are increasingly irrelevant
- GitHub is the most popular host

### Why this is a good way to make a website

- static sites have fast page load times
- static sites have low security risks
- using a generator separates content from style (mostly)
- someone else writes the HTML/CSS/Javascript
- you can change the theme in ~100 characters or less
- responsive site without doing the work
- common accessibility built in with no effort
- GitHub pages is free!
- **very** little of this site is GitHub specific, you can move to a different host pretty easily, with just a little understanding


## VS Code orientation

- accept and launch code space (this takes several minutes)
- it is set up to do a lot for you, 
- open the port & view your site
- still private, this is what it will look like
- note: responsive (adjust screen, inspect)

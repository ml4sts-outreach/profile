# Changing Host

The only thing about this that is specific to GitHub is the `.github` directory with the script for github to build and serve your site.  

You can move to a different git host (like git lab) by just replacing that with their CI tools.  

You could also build the site locally and then post the plain HTML files anywhere (like the web server provided to most faculty/grad students).

# Work time / Advanced Customization and adding Content

Pick a Code tour in the repo and follow along to continue customizing your site. The tours provided help you to: 
- set your profile picture
- add more pages
- create a news/blog feature
- customize the menus

It is probably best to go through these in this order, but it is set up that if you skip the news/blog everything wilol make sense. 

```{importnat}
Remember to commit and sync your work so that it gets to github.com.
```

You might also want to explore the [resources](resource/index.md) section of this site for more ideas and help.

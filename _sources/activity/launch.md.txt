# Launching your site

As is, your site is "owned" by the github organization `ml4sts-outreach`. 
I did this so that I can help you during the workshop, but I gave you
full admin access to it, so that you can take ownership and make it your
own. 

If you want to actually use the site, you will need to
[transfer ownership to yourself](https://docs.github.com/en/repositories/creating-and-managing-repositories/transferring-a-repository#transferring-a-repository-owned-by-your-organization).  Then you will likely want to [rename the repository]() to `username.github.io` but with your actual github username in place of `username`.


After these two steps, then you will be able to see your rendered website at `username.github.io` instead of `ml4sts-outreach.github.io/nsbe50-profile-username`. 

If you own (or buy) your own domain, then you can set it up to [use your custom domain](https://docs.github.com/en/pages/configuring-a-custom-domain-for-your-github-pages-site/managing-a-custom-domain-for-your-github-pages-site)

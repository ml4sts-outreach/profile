# Launching your site

As is, your site is "owned" by the github organization `ml4sts-outreach` and your site is visible online at: `ml4sts-outreach.github.io/nsbe50-profile-username`. 
I did this for two reasons: 
- We can help you during the workshop
- Your site is not your "official" profile until you are ready
  
However, you have full admin access to it, so 
 you can take ownership and make it your own. 

To do this: 
1. [transfer ownership to yourself](https://docs.github.com/en/repositories/creating-and-managing-repositories/transferring-a-repository#transferring-a-repository-owned-by-your-organization)
2. [rename the repository](https://docs.github.com/en/repositories/creating-and-managing-repositories/renaming-a-repository) to `username.github.io` but with your actual github username in place of `username`.
3. *(otionally)* Buy a custom domain and set up to [use your custom domain](https://docs.github.com/en/pages/configuring-a-custom-domain-for-your-github-pages-site/managing-a-custom-domain-for-your-github-pages-site)


After the first two steps, then you will be able to see your rendered website at `username.github.io` instead of `ml4sts-outreach.github.io/nsbe50-profile-username`. 


I buy and manage my domains from [namecheap](https://www.namecheap.com/) but there are many others you can use. The only requirement is that you have DNS panel access.

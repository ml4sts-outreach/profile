# Workshop

## Overview

- Welcome 
- Why use these tools for a website?
- Guided Setup of your workshop
- Open practice/customization
- Wrap up: How to keep working later

##  Get started


First, you will need to [create a github account](https://github.com/signup)


```{warning}
At an event use the link provided in person.
```

The link to copy the template for the workshop is different during an actual workshop, that gives
access to a version to provide Dr. Brown and any workshop helpers write permission to your site

Then you need to create a repo using the [template](https://github.com/ml4sts-outreach/template-profile) or **"accept the assignment"** from Dr. Brown as provided in person.
